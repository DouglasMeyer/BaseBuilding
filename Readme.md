# Base Building game

Based on Quill18's [Unity game tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbghT7MmckI4_VM5q3va043FgAwRim6yX).

I'm following his tutorial idea, but:

* Programming it in JS.
* Using custom game framework.
* Using [pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) for rendering.

Why? I like the web as a development platform, I'm comfortable in JS, and existing JS game frameworks either seem too heavy-handed or not worth the abstraction (I could be wrong).

What to expect:

* Similar, if not same, functionality as Quill's game.
* Different approach to achieving same goals.
* Changes in said approach and game framework (mostly because I'm not familiar with game development, and the game framework hasn't seen much use).
